# RP_TPF
    This program is the supplementary files of the paper: “Exact Solutions for the Riemann Problem of Two-Parameter Fluid”.
    This program calculates the exact solutions of the Riemann problem of two-parameter fluid described by PR EoS.
    The "main" file is the solver, in which the initial conditions of the Riemann problem are input.
    The "cal_PR" file is the PR equation and thermodynamic property calculation program, in which the physical properties of the fluid are input.
    There are detailed comments in each of the other programs.

    The paper has not been published yet. This website only displays 12 subroutines in the program. The remaining subroutines will be uploaded to this website after the paper is published.
